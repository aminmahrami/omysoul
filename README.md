### Enhance worship, prayer, Bible study with tech

The web makes possible exciting new ways to worship, pray and study the Bible. This is specially true of realtime technologies like web sockets and WebRTC which allow users in the same room or spread halfway around the world to share an experience. We aim to produce tools that allow people to share in a Bible study or see lyrics while worshiping.

We hope to save churches the money they would normally spend on worship and presentation software. And free them from the wires that are needed to run multiple screens.

### Evangelism on the web

Jesus tasks each believer with sharing the message of the Bible with all creation:

> Go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature.

The web gives ordinary believers the opportunity of reaching many thousands of people.

### Persecution resistant software

In some countries being discovered as a Christian can cost a believer their freedom or their life. Many countries filter the internet blocking out content they disagree with. Using peer to peer, offline storage and encryption can help create software that better protects the persecuted church.

### Encouraging an Open Source ethos in Christian Media

Encourage worship leaders and Bible translators to make song lyrics and Bible translations available under licenses which enable app creators to use this content creatively to reach lost people and glorify God. E.g.

[Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 2.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.0/)

This license allows rights holders to exploit the commercial potential of translations and lyrics while permitting the use of this media for evangelism.

### Prayer for the web

Decisions made by Google, Apple, Facebook & Microsoft affect the lives of billions of people. So do the decisions governments, NGOs, patent trolls, courts & hosting companies. Raising a technical topic in a traditional prayer meeting may get a less than enthusiastic response.

So we aim to facilitate prayer for the web on web so Christians in various tech communities can pray into the areas they care about with like minded people.   

### Be a light in the tech community

One side effect of prayer is that it changes things for the better. We are not ashamed to our faith. Faith can be a taboo subject in the tech community. It is tempting for Christians to hide it. But Jesus tells believers not to hide their light under a bowl. So we don't want to hide our hope in a way that is unnatural.

### Amplify the voice of poor and oppressed

Social media has the effect of amplifying certain voices. But believers are told to be the voice for the voiceless. There are ways that technology can help with this. The Internet now reaches into some of poorest and most desperate places in the world. We want to find those crying out for help and provide them with tools that enable their to voice heard.

> Shout it aloud, do not hold back. Raise your voice like a trumpet. Declare to my people their rebellion ... they seem eager to know my ways, as if they were a nation that does what is right and has not forsaken the commands of its God.

> Is not this the kind of fasting I have chosen: to loose the chains of injustice and untie the cords of the yoke, to set the oppressed free and break every yoke?

> Is it not to share your food with the hungry and to provide the poor wanderer with shelter- when you see the naked, to clothe him, and not to turn away from your own flesh and blood?

> Then your light will break forth like the dawn, and your healing will quickly appear; then your righteousness will go before you, and the glory of the LORD will be your rear guard. __(Isa 58)__
