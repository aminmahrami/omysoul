### Enhance worship, prayer, Bible study with tech

The web makes possible exciting new ways to worship, pray and study the Bible. This is specially true of realtime technologies like web sockets and WebRTC which allow users in the same room or spread halfway around the world to share an experience. We aim to produce tools that allow people to share in a Bible study or see lyrics while worshiping.

We hope to save churches the money they would normally spend on worship and presentation software. And free them from the wires that are needed to run multiple screens.

### Evangelism on the web

Jesus tasks each believer with sharing the message of the Bible with all creation:

> Go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature.

The web gives ordinary believers the opportunity of reaching many thousands of people.

### Persecution resistant software

In some countries being discovered as a Christian can cost a believer their freedom or their life. Many countries filter the internet blocking out content they disagree with. Using peer to peer, offline storage and encryption can help create software that better protects the persecuted church.

### Encouraging an Open Source ethos in Christian Media

We would like to encourage worship leaders and Bible translators to make song lyrics and Bible translations available under licenses which enable app creators to use this content creatively to reach lost people and glorify God. E.g.

[Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 2.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.0/)

This license allows rights holders to exploit the commercial potential of translations and lyrics while permitting the use of this media for evangelism.
